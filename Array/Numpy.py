#Numpy (Numerical Python) is a popular Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for working with large,
# multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on them efficiently.
# .view(): for shallow copy of an array.
# .copy(): for deep copy of an array.
# .ndim: to get the number or array.

import numpy
arr = numpy.array ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr * 2)
print(numpy.mean(arr))
