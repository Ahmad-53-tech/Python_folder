 # Variables: They are containers that holds values that can change during program execution.
#                                   Types of Variables
# - Global Variables: Used Everywhere
# - Local Variables: Used only in a specific point.

# Constants: They are fixed values that cannot be changed

# Naming conventions: They are ways you use in Naming variables. They include: Pascal case, camel case, snakes-case, kebab case, hebrew convention.
# Types of Naming Conventions
# - Pascal Case: It means that every first letter of every word in a variable must be capitalized. E.g., UserFirstName.
# - Camel Case: It means that every first letter of every word is capitalized except the first letter of the first word. E.g., userFirstName.
# - Snake Case: It means that every word is written in a small letter and separated by an underscore. E.g., user_first_name.
# - Kebab Case: It means every word is written in a small letter but is separated by hyphen. E.g., user-first-name (is not allowed in python).
# - Hebrew's Convention: It is a convention where the first letter of a variable name represents
# the data type where every other first letter of every word must be capitalized. E.g., sUserFirstName

#                                   Data Types
# - Data types: They represent the kind of data or value variables hold. They include strings, integers, float and boolean etc.
#                                Types of Data Types
# - Strings: They are a data type that holds characters either in single or double quotations.
# - Integers: They are whole numbers.
# - Float: They are decimals.
# - Boolean: They are True or False values

# - Operators
#                               Types of Operators
# - Arithmetic Operators: (+, -, *, /, %)
# - Logical Operators: (AND, OR, NOT)
# - Assignment Operators: (=)
# - Relational Operators: (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)


# - Concatenation: This is used to join two or more strings together.


# - Type Casting: Changing from one data type to another.
# - Type Function: Checking the data type a variable is holding.


#Function: Container for few lines of code that performs a specific task.
# - We have two types of functions. They are Parameterized and unparameterized function.
# - Parameterized function: They take values inside the function's parenthesis
# - Unparameterized function: They do not take values inside the function's parenthesis

# Parameters: They are variables used in your functions.
# Argument: They are values your parameters work with.


# Loops: Allows us to execute a block of code multiple times without writing repetitive code manually. 
#                               Types of loops 
# - For loops: They execute a block of code for a fixed number of times. It can be used to iterate over a range, sequence, and string.
#It Can also be used to construct a definite loop.
# - While Loops: They execute some code while some conditions are true.

#Nested Loops: Having a loop inside another loop


# break: it allows us to exit a loop
# continue: Used for skipping a character
# The range function is used to generate a sequence of number.
# range(start, stop, step) 
# start - the starting value of a sequence
# stop - the stopping value of a sequence
# step - the difference of values in a sequence




#Nonetype = They represent null value. E.g., Result = None etc.

#Set = They represent unordered collection of unique items.
# E.g. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) etc.

#Dictionary = They are a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are unique.
# E.g., Person = ("name": "Serwaa", "age": 30, "City": "Accra")

#List = An ordered collection of items, which can be of mixed data types.
#Fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
#mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.5, True]

#Tuple = An ordered unchangeable collection of items.
#Coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
#user_info = ("Alice", 30, "Engineer")

# in bitwise operations (0 &(and) 1 = 0) (0 |(or) 1 = 1) 
#   (0 ^(XOR) 1 = 1) when both are the same = 0
#    for left shift(<<) two zeros will be added, for right shift(>>) two bits will be lost.
