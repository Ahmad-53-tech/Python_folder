# SECTION 1: VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS
#1.
# Variables are containers that hold values that can change during program execution
# x = 10 # Here, 'x' is a variable that holds the value 10.
# x = x + 5 # The value of 'x' is now updated to 15
# Contents are fixed values that do not change during program execution
# PI = 3.14159 
#'PI' is treated as a constant.

#2.
# Assigning Value
name = "Princess"
print(name)

# Modifying it (1)
name = "Elijah"
print(name)

# Modifying it (2)
name = "Esther"
print(name)

# Assigning Constant
print("Hello World")

# Modifying the Constant
print("Hello Guys")

# The program allowed the value to be changed, but normally it is not supposed to.
# Constants are fixed values, so it should be understood that it is not
# supposed to be changed

#3.

years_until_100 = 100 - age
# Displaying the result
if years_until_100 > 0: print("You are above 100 years")

    print("Congratulations! You are 100 years old.")

if years_until_100 < 100:
    print("You will turn 100 in" , years_until_100 , "years")


#SECTION 2: DATA TYPES
#1.
#Integer: They represent whole numbers, positive or negative without decimals.
#E.g., 1, 20, 53 etc.

#String: They represent sequences of characters enclosed in single
# or double quotes. E,g. name = "Ahmad", Greetings = 'Good morning' etc.

#Boolean: They represent true or false value. E.g. i_am_robot = False
#i_am_human = True

#Float: They represent numbers with decimals. E.g. 3.14, 9.0, 8.55 etc.

#Nonetype = They represent null value. E.g., Result = None etc.

#Set = They represent unordered collection of unique items.
# E.g. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) etc.

#Dictionary = They are a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are unique.
# E.g., Person = ("name": "Serwaa", "age": 30, "City": "Accra")

#List = An ordered collection of items, which can be of mixed data types.
#fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
#mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.5, True]

#Tuple = An ordered unchangeable collection of items.
#coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
#user_info = ("Alice", 30, "Engineer")

print("Hello",name +"!"+"," ,"You are",age,"years old and your height is",height,"meters")


#SECTION 3: OPERATORS
#1.
#Arithmetic Operators = Used to perform mathematical operations.
#they are (+,-,/,*,**,%)
#E.g. x=3, y=5, z=6. Calculate c=(y**x+5-z)%2
#c=0

#Comparison Operators = Used to compare two values and return a Boolean result.
#they are (==, !=, <=, >=, <, >.)
#E.g.
#x = (10 == 5)  # x = False
#y = (10 != 5)  # y = True
#z = (10 > 5)  # z = True
#a = (10 < 5)  # a = False
#b = (10 >= 5)  # b = True
#c = (10 <= 5)  # c = False

#Logical Operators = Used to combine conditional statements.
#they are (AND, OR NOT).
#E.g., x = (True and False) # x = False
# = (True or False) # y = True
#z= not True # z = False

#Assignment Operators = Used to assign values to variables.
# we have only one, and it is the "="
