#  for _ in score: What is the meaning of this statement.

#The underscore _ in the statement for _ in score: is a convention in Python that indicates the loop variable is not going to be used.
#Explanation:
#Normally, in a for loop, we assign each item from an iterable (like a list) to a variable.
#If we donâ€™t actually need to use the variable inside the loop, we use _ as a placeholder.
