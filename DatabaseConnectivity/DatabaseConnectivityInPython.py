# A database is an organised collection of structured information. Database connectivity means establishing a link between a python program and a
#database management system(DBMS).


#                           REASONS FOR CONNECTING PYTHON TO DATABASE
#1. To save user information.
#2. To fetch or organise big data.
#3. To support multi-user systems.
#4. To perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations.


#                           TYPES OF DATABASE
#1. Relational Databases(RDBMS): This stores data in tables (rows and columns). E.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, MS SQL Server.
#2. NOSQL Databases: This stores data in non-tabular forms (Documents, Graph). E.g. MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.


#                           BASIC STEPS TO CONNECT PYTHON TO DATABASE
#1. Import the required database module.
#2. Establish a connection to the database.
#3. Create a cursor object to interact with the database.
#4. Execute SQL queries using the cursor.
#5. Commit changes (if needed) and close the connection.

# WHY CODE IS NEEDED FOR DATABASE OPERATIONS
# 1. With code, you can automate repetitive operations ensuring
#consistency and efficiency. For example, you can create scripts that automatically insert data into the database at regular intervals or perform bug update.
#2. Code allows you to integrate database integrations directly with the logic of your application. This means that when a user interacts with your application (submit
#a form), the data can be automatically inserted, updated or deleted in the database without manual intervention.
#3. Code allows you to scale operations. you can automate the insertion of large volumes of data using loops or perform complex queries to extract large data sets in
#seconds.
#4. When writing code to interact with the database, you can implement validation checks to ensure that only valid data is entered.
#5. When using code, you can use placeholders to prevent SQL injection.
#6. Code can be shared, versioned and deployed across various environments.
#7. Using code allows for easy tracking and documentation of changes.
