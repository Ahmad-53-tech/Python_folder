# A database is an organised collection of structured information. Database connectivity means establishing a link between a python program and a
#database management system(DBMS).


#                           REASONS FOR CONNECTING PYTHON TO DATABASE
#1. To save user information.
#2. To fetch or organise big data.
#3. To support multi-user systems.
#4. To perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations.


#                           TYPES OF DATABASE
#1. Relational Databases(RDBMS): This stores data in tables (rows and columns). E.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, MS SQL Server.
#2. NOSQL Databases: This stores data in non-tabular forms (Documents, Graph). E.g. MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.


#                           BASIC STEPS TO CONNECT PYTHON TO DATABASE
#1. Import the required database module.
#2. Establish a connection to the database.
#3. Create a cursor object to interact with the database.
#4. Execute SQL queries using the cursor.
#5. Commit changes (if needed) and close the connection.
