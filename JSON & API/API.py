# - Headers: This is a dictionary that holds HTTP headers sent with an API request.

# - Content-Type: This is an HTTP header that tells the server what type of data is being sent in the request body. It ensures that
#the server correctly interprets the request data.

# - Application/JSON: This indicates that the request body contains data formatted as JSON.

# - Authorisation: This is the HTTP header used to send authorisation credentials to the server.

# - Bearer: This is a token-based authentication scheme, it means that the request is authorized because it bears a token.

# - API KEY: This is the actual API KEY(token) used to authenticate request, the API Server checks if the token is valid before
#processing the request.

# - OAuth2 Authentication: It is a secure way for applications to authenticate and access protected resources without needing username
#and password for every request, instead of sending login details all the time. OAuth2 provides a token that the client can use to
#access resources.
#                               Reasons for using OAuth2
# * It is more secure. There is no need to send password or username repeatedly.
# * It is token-based: Access token expires after some time, reducing security risks.
# * It is widely used: APIs from Google, facebook, GitHub, etc. uses OAuth2.

#GET Request (Fetch Data)

#Handling API Authentication

#OAuth 2.0 Authentication
# client_id = "your_client_id" #Given by the API provider
client_secret= "your_client_secret" #Also given by the provider
# token_url = "https://example.com/oauth/token" #URL to get the access token
